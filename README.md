# Vagrant-Ethereum Box
A **real environment**-friendly, **virtual environment** for development on Ethereum

* Want a (real) Ethereum node running locally on your machine for development?
* Want sub-second block times?
* Don't like it when your laptop roars like it's about to take off and becomes so hot, you can literally make breakfast on it?
* Like trees, polar bears, squirrels and those weird tiny monkeys living in Amazon forests?

... then stop ~~being a dick~~ mining in dev and use this Box.

## Dependencies

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) (1.7.4 or later)
* nfsd (pre-installed on OS X, typically a simple package install on Linux)

## Usage:

`vagrant up` from wherever you cloned this, wait, then RPC the shit out of `http://localhost:8545`.

## How does this work?

Do you really give a shit?

* YES! https://github.com/ethcore/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains
* NO! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uUuRD_atfI

## Still not convinced you need this? **LOOK AT THE MONKEY**
